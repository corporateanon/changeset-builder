# changeset-releaser - a missing Atlassian Changesets companion tool

`changeset-releaser` allows you to test, build and run custom scripts in your monorepo incrementally, i.e. only for the packages that have changed and their dependencies and/or dependents.

See the [package's Readme](packages/changeset-releaser/Readme.md) for more information.
